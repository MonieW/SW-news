A  developer must add two .env files, to connect to the two databases locally
these are
.env.test
.env.development
Into each add PGDATABASE= followed by the correct database for that environment (see setup.sql for each name)
Make sure these files are .gitignored by checking your gitignore
At this point run npm install
